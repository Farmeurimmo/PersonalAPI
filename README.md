# PersonalAPI

This API is used to access views for my portfolio (blog part), my public minecraft demo
server and for a better updater than spigot in my minecraft plugins (because of
spigot api cache that is not updated often).

This API support url versioning, so for example, if you don't specify a version,
the latest version will be used.
If an endpoint is removed (like v1 and you still have v2), the v2 will be used.

## Docs ?

The documentation is a little bit unstable and not complete, but you can find it at https://api.farmeurimmo.fr/docs.
